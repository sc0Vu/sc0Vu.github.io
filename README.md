# sc0Vu.github.io
My github io site.

Just put some of my project.

Frankly speaking, the website visual design was terrible.

# Thought
When I want to make my portfolio website, I think maybe we can use another thread to get resource and change the web content.

This method might speed up the website loading time.

Then, I start to build this website.

In this website, I use worker to fetch the resource and localStorage to remember the page.

Maybe I will use another web api future.

|-------|      |------|
|       |      |      |
| worker|  ->  | DATA |
